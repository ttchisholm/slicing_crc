# Slicing-by-N CRC FPGA

[![cocotb-test](https://github.com/ttchisholm/slicing_crc/actions/workflows/cocotb-test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ttchisholm/slicing_crc/actions/workflows/cocotb-test.yaml)

This is a Slicing-by-N CRC implementation in SystemVerilog for FPGA (or ASIC). The algorithm is based on the method invented by Intel engineers in 2006 as an extension to Sarwate's algorithm.

Random verification performed with cocotb and cocotb-test.
